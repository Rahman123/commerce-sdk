```

## Usage
To use an SDK client, an object of that client must be instantiated with the following configuration parameters.
```yaml
baseUri: Url of the service the SDK should interact with
clientId: Id of the client account created with Salesforce Commerce Cloud
clientSecret: Secret associated with the client id provided above
authHost: URL of the authentication provider
headers (Optional): Additional HTTP headers to be associated with the requests
```

 */

let express = require('express');

// Import the SDK
const CommerceSdk = require('commerce-sdk');
const Shop = CommerceSdk.Shop;

// Instantiate Shop client object with the configuration details
const shopClient = new Shop({
    baseUri: "https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1/links/a9f65fa0-7ee2-4ba8-b532-49bfdd1b482c/shop",

    clientSecret: 'test-client-secret',
    authHost: 'https://somwehere.safe.com',
    headers: '{ "Cache-control": "no-cache" }'
});
